A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level  i.e.  time[i]*satisfaction[i]

Return the maximum sum of Like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.



Example 1:

Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total Like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14). Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
Example 2:

Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
Example 3:

Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People don't like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
Example 4:

Input: satisfaction = [-2,5,-1,0,3,-3]
Output: 35


Constraints:

n == satisfaction.length
1 <= n <= 500
-10^3 <= satisfaction[i] <= 10^3
