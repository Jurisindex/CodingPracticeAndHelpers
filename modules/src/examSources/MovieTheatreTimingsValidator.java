/*
Given a movie's run time and given screentime available hours, I want to be able to play it:

-The maximum amount of times
-Give priority to intervals of 5 (playing it 215 minutes into operation over 214 minutes in, per say)

Example:
Movie Length : 107 minutes
Length of Operation: 862 minutes

I can play the movie 8 times, with it start on a 5 interval 5 times. On the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th play.
